# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:

  assets:
    - assets/cfg/
    - assets/img/
    - assets/svg/

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: ProductSans
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/ProductSans-Thin.ttf
          weight: 100
        - asset: assets/fonts/ProductSans-Thin.ttf
          weight: 200
        - asset: assets/fonts/ProductSans-Light.ttf
          weight: 300
        - asset: assets/fonts/ProductSans-Regular.ttf
          weight: 400
